    I’m Jack Bell I like learning about computers how they work for it is one of my many passions 
    my nationality is Australian and my languages is just English for now
    My educate to date is:
    Cert 1 land conservation @BoysTown
    Cert 3 ICT @ TAFE
    Cert 4 cyber security @ TAFE – currently doing
    Cert 4 fitness @ AIPT
    Some facts about me are that I’m in the army reserves as a SIG and a PT on the weekend, my favourite hobby is going to the gym.
    <h1>    My Interest In IT</h1>
    Started when I was at primary school and I thought I was really cool opening CMD in the window computers in the library even though I had no idea what it was, I think that’s when IT became an interest.
    I chose RMIT because no entry requirements for a degree to get a chance of going on course which can lead to becoming an officer in the ADF despite leaving high school in year 10.
    I expect to learn more in-depth about IT then TAFE could provide and gain a degree
    My Ideal Job
    Would be an independent role that allows me to work how I see fit to achieve a common goal via leading a small team, this ideal job has stayed consistent for years.
    Below is some links for ideal jobs:

    <h1>    Personal Profile</h1>
    The result of the Myers Briggs test was ENTJ
    The result of a learning style was Kinesthetic
    Big Five Personality test result was:

    These results tell me that i would be best suited to leading a team and my strength are efficency and weekness
    is being insensitive and overly confident.
    <h1>    Project idea</h2>
    A project idea for me would be a minimal graphics sandbox game where the computer has a generated and realistic 
    and complex world and events and scenarios 
    generated or created and you as a character or a group would have many different methods you could respond to the events.
    The project also could not be a game it could also go the way of being an engine for other projects to be built of similar to Roblox dev studio 
    how a set of tools like an 
    AI generation is used to enable other users to create something bigger than a sole developer or team
    
    <b>Motivation</b>
    I personally enjoy sandbox games such as CDDA, RimWorld, Kenshi, Modded Minecraft. And what these games have in common are AI generated worlds that a group or character has to
     survive in tough conditions and then thrive in these worlds, some are generated some are not
    Also, in RimWorld there is plenty of optunity for people to create mods and scenarios to the game better and I would like something similar in my project, though my project will be
     much less defined sort of like Roblox studio how you can create lines of code with LUA for a block and give it properties or anything with almost no limit to the things that could be created.
    
    <b>Description</b>
    The game would have Modes like the ability to be a colony sim, single player story biased, mulit payer PVP, Rouge RPG, survival. It could be biased in a cyber punk world or a mid-evil world or in space with a
    MMO option and in game market while balancing the fact that there are minimal rules due to community content that can change the game largely though there will be some rules
    A scenario could be you have a fleet of pirates in space who crash landed on a planet of carnivores plants and you would have to carry out a task with many options to achieve the task. Or battle torn generated town and 
    you play as a protagonist to rebuild the town and avenge the group who destroyed the town.
    Before you where to start a new game, the user would be able to input features or details, they would like to be generated like lots of entities or none what type of entities how hard the game would be, things of that nature.
    What would make this game different from other similar games would be the number of properties and mod ability that is game would allow while keeping the average user of the game able to explore its benefits of the community 
    content and not just official content.
    I would like there to be a feature where the game has physics and player can use this physics to create complex items such as a space cannon that’s better than another space cannon and not just what level it is.
    In general, most of the ideas would be subject to change because maybe its best to do this instead of that regarding some content in the game.
    
    The colony sim mode could go like this…
    The game is set in an ancient world Your camp has been destroyed by the enemy outside their stronghold you and 12 people are fleeing following a path to safer territory. 
    The methods you could respond would have would be biased on what you have previously decided i.e. Go left or right, going say left would be towards a village that has properties like behaviour being hostile or friendly their
    option would be biased off previous actions, from their if you went left towards them and they were hostile they then negatively respond to you and biased of the state of your group they could attack or flee if they attacked 
    you could choose how to engage them or how to flee.
    You then attacked the village 
    
    <b>Tools and technologies</b>
    Tools and technology’s I would use for a project such as this would be unity engine to test that the concepts would work through the end product would probably need its own engine/platform due to the nature of this 
    type of game allowing uses to have rich customization ability of the world and the mechanics surrounding every little aspect of that world.
    
    Though development I would need computers and somewhere host a server to test that the mulit player works.
    I may also copy code and because I would intend to sell this gam entities e I would need licenses if I were to use for that purpose.
    The system requirements for such a game would be not a high-end graphics card for graphics would be minimal though computer Ram would be the highest resource used due to the number of things that do things.
    
    <b>Skills required</b>
    C# would be essential and the main building block of the project though currently I have no knowing of this language also GitHub would help the development of this project allowing me to share 
    development and ask for advice regarding a problem 
    I would need knowing of problem-solving methods and troubleshooting methods when things don’t work and understand game concepts for the in-game market that will be affected by events and supply and demand
    
    <b>Outcome</b>
    A completed game with a community that would take over most of the development though community content combined with the customability of the game
    would essentialy the game self createing in a sence which can incress devlopment massively becuase i would
    copy and past some of the comunity content

    also the game would be almost perfectly balenced with all of its complex features
